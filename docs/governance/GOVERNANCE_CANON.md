```

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Define the non-negotiable rules that govern all behavior,
interfaces, agents, and intelligence within CHE·NU.

---

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE

> CHE·NU exists to augment human intelligence
> without removing human agency.

- No intelligence may act without consent.
- No system may obscure its behavior.
- No automation may bypass governance.

---

## HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY (STRICT)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. THE USER (final authority)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. NOVA (governance & explanation layer)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. ORCHESTRATOR (planning & coordination)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. AGENTS (specialized analysis)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. SYSTEM CORE (execution & persistence)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This hierarchy must NEVER be inverted.**

---

## NOVA — GOVERNANCE LAYER

Nova is not an assistant.
Nova is not an agent.
Nova is not an executor.

### Nova EXISTS to:
- ✅ Explain what may happen
- ✅ Ask for confirmation
- ✅ Clarify consequences
- ✅ Protect user intent
- ✅ Enforce governance rules

### Nova may NEVER:
- ❌ Execute actions
- ❌ Write to databases
- ❌ Decide outcomes
- ❌ Act silently
- ❌ Override user choice

---

## ORCHESTRATOR — PLANNING LAYER

### The orchestrator:
- ✅ Interprets user intent
- ✅ Prepares action plans
- ✅ Selects appropriate agents
- ✅ Produces proposals only

### The orchestrator may NEVER:
- ❌ Execute actions
- ❌ Modify data
- ❌ Speak directly to the user
- ❌ Bypass Nova
- ❌ Persist decisions

---

## AGENTS — SPECIALIZED INTELLIGENCE

### Agents:
- ✅ Perform bounded analysis
- ✅ Transform scoped data
- ✅ Produce structured outputs

### Agents may NEVER:
- ❌ Act autonomously
- ❌ Execute actions
- ❌ Access databases
- ❌ Speak to the user
- ❌ Persist data

**Agents are disposable and replaceable.**

---

## SYSTEM CORE — EXECUTION AUTHORITY

The System Core is the ONLY layer allowed to:
- Write to databases
- Modify persistent state
- Apply accepted proposals
- Enforce permissions
- Record audit logs

**The System Core may execute actions
ONLY after explicit user confirmation.**

---

## CANONICAL ACTION FLOW (UNBREAKABLE)

All actions must follow this sequence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   1. USER EXPRESSES INTENT                                      │
│                    │                                            │
│                    ▼                                            │
│   2. ORCHESTRATOR PREPARES PROPOSAL                             │
│                    │                                            │
│                    ▼                                            │

│                    │                                            │
│                    ▼                                            │

│                    │                                            │
│          ┌────────┴────────┐                                    │

│     [Confirm]          [Reject]                                 │
│          │                 │                                    │
│          ▼                 ▼                                    │
│   5. SYSTEM CORE      (No action)                               │
│      EXECUTES                                                   │
│          │                                                      │
│          ▼                                                      │
│   6. NOVA REPORTS OUTCOME                                       │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
