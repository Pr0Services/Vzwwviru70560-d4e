# GOVERNANCE CANON (AT-OM / CHE-NU)
**Status:** Foundation · Non-negotiable

## 1) Definition
**Governance** in AT-OM is continuous, proportional correction that preserves direction during execution.
It is not after-the-fact validation.

> Execution creates value. Governance preserves direction.

## 2) Core doctrine
1. **Single source of truth:** all state-changing actions are thread events.
2. **Append-only:** history is immutable; corrections are appended.
3. **Projection model:** chat/live/xr are views; no duplicated memory.
4. **Human sovereignty:** humans approve important decisions; agents recommend and enforce rules.
5. **Selective intelligence:** compute is focused where risk lives.
6. **Realtime alignment:** drift is corrected early, not repaired late.
7. **Transparency:** every governance action is logged as an event.
8. **Least privilege:** each agent has minimal rights for its role.
9. **Cost/latency aware:** governance adapts to budgets and mode (live vs async).
10. **Learning loop:** backlogs feed continuous improvement of orchestration policies.

## 3) Canon components
- **Thread** (source of truth)
- **Orchestrator** (decision authority for routing, checks, escalation)
- **Executor** (produces work)
- **Memory Agent** (guardian of continuity)
- **Criterion Enforcement Agents (CEA)** (specialized checkers)
- **Specialist Workers** (deep / domain-specific, invoked locally)

## 4) Forbidden
- Duplicated memory stores (chat/live/xr)
- Autonomous XR state as truth
- Silent rewrites or deletions of events
- Always-on costly agents without explicit scheduling
- Agents changing permissions without governance flow
