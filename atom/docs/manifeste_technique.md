# Manifeste Technique — AT-OM / CHE-NU (V76)

AT-OM is not a database. It is a **Resonance Engine**.

## The promise
- Reduce intellectual friction ("patinage").
- Replace linear navigation with **resonance jumps** (frequency, causal links, and multi-dimensional anchors).

## Core invariants
- **Core Number:** 4 (structure / foundation)
- **Core Heartbeat:** 444 Hz (system default tone)
- **No silent writes:** everything stored must carry provenance or be marked hypothesis.
- **Chronology first:** causal links cannot go backward in time.

## Causal anchors
Each Node may carry (and link across) four anchors:
1. Physical (tools, energy, materials)
2. Biological (genes, physiology, adaptations)
3. Social (customs, law, economy)
4. Spirit (symbols, belief, meaning)

## Scientific posture
AT-OM can explore symbolic mappings (linguistics/arithmos) **without** presenting them as scientific proof.
We separate:
- **facts** (source-backed)
- **interpretations** (clearly labeled)

This is how the engine stays powerful *and* defensible.
