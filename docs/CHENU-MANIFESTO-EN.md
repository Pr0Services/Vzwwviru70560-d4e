# CHE·NU — CANONICAL MANIFESTO (EN)

> *Directional Operating System for Human Intention, Decision-Making, and Continuity*

---

## MISSION

You are working on **CHE·NU**: a directional operating system for human intention, decision-making, and continuity.

CHE·NU is **not tied to any industry**.
Domains (business, construction, education, institutions, creative work, personal life, XR) are treated as **interchangeable spheres**.

**The core system must remain domain-agnostic.**

---

## OBJECTIVE

Implement a directional system that allows a human to:

- move through complex intentions **safely**
- explore **without fear of loss**
- make decisions **with accountability**
- rewind context **without erasing responsibility**
- resume work **without cognitive friction**

**The system must guide without enforcing and clarify without overwhelming.**

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1) HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP

- No agent, automation, or algorithm may finalize decisions.
- Agents advise only.
- Humans validate all meaningful state changes.

### 2) TIMELINE AS SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

- The timeline is append-only.
- No event is ever deleted or rewritten.
- All views (UI, XR, analytics, replay) are derived from it.

### 3) INTENTION OVER ACTION

- Users do not navigate screens.
- Users move through intentional states.
- Every meaningful interaction must map to an explicit intention.

### 4) ROLLBACK IS INTERPRETATION, NOT ERASURE

- Rewinding means changing the active reading point.
- Past decisions always remain visible.
- Responsibility is preserved.

---

## PATHS (DIRECTIONAL FLOWS)

A **PATH** is a constrained progression of intentional states.
Paths are limited by design to reduce cognitive overload.

**Only four primary paths are allowed.**

---

### PATH A — RESUME

**Intent:** *"I want to continue where I left off."*

**Entry:**
- Application start
- Return from inactivity

**Allowed options:**
- Continue as-is
- Change preset (mode)
- Change active sphere

**Rollback:**
- Return to neutral state

**Persistence:**
- Automatic save of last validated state

**Restrictions:**
- No new decisions written
- No intrusive agent suggestions

---

### PATH B — NEW INTENTION

**Intent:** *"I want to start something new."*

**Entry:**
- User expresses a goal in one sentence

**Allowed options:**
- Select sphere
- Select preset
- Estimate duration

**Rollback:**
- Cancel before validation
- Return to neutral state

**Persistence:**
- Only after explicit human validation

**Restrictions:**
- No implicit creation
- No automatic timeline writes

---

### PATH C — EXPLORATION

**Intent:** *"I want to think, explore, or understand."*

**Entry:**
- Exploration preset activated

**Allowed options:**
- Take notes
- Switch to focus
- Mark ideas as important

**Rollback:**
- Return to last stable state
- Discard entire exploration state

**Persistence:**
- Only explicitly marked items

**Restrictions:**
- No forced commitment
- No silent persistence

---

### PATH D — DECISION

**Intent:** *"I am making a decision."*

**Entry:**
- Explicit decision action

**Allowed options:**
- Review context
- Request analysis
- Compare alternatives

**Rollback:**
- Return to pre-decision context
- Decision itself is never removed

**Persistence:**
- Always written to the timeline

**Restrictions:**
- No deletion
- No rewriting of decisions

---

## OPTIONS & INTERACTIONS

Every option must answer **ONE clear human question**.

**Examples of valid options:**
- "Change mode?"
- "Save this idea?"
- "Continue or return?"

**Forbidden options:**
- Automatic actions without explanation
- Silent optimizations
- Decisions without validation

---

## ROLLBACK RULES

**Rollback behavior:**
- Never writes to timeline
- Never removes past events
- Only repositions the active context pointer

**Forbidden rollback behavior:**
- Deleting events
- Rewriting history
- Masking past responsibility

---

## SESSION PERSISTENCE

**Persist only what matters:**
- active preset
- active sphere
- last validated intention
- timeline pointer

**Never persist:**
- raw UI state
- transient visuals
- unvalidated thoughts

**Persistence triggers:**
- explicit validation
- session end

---

## LIMITATIONS (DESIGN BY CONSTRAINT)

These limitations are intentional and **must not be bypassed**:

| Limitation | Constraint |
|------------|------------|
| Maximum primary paths | **4** |
| Destructive undo | **Never** |
| Autonomous agents | **Never** |
| Domain-specific core logic | **Never** |
| Deep navigation trees | **Never** |

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The system is successful if:

- ✅ the user always knows where they are
- ✅ exploration feels safe
- ✅ decisions feel accountable
- ✅ closing the app feels complete
- ✅ resuming feels effortless

---

## IMPORTANT

> **Do not add features.**
> **Do not optimize behavior.**
> **Do not introduce domain assumptions.**
>
> **Your task is to reinforce clarity, direction, and continuity.**

## SUMMARY OF LAWS

```
📜 LAW 1: Timeline = Absolute Truth (append-only)
📜 LAW 2: Human Validation Required
📜 LAW 3: Rollback = Reposition (never deletion)
📜 LAW 4: Maximum 4 Paths (A/B/C/D)
📜 LAW 5: Human > System, Always
```
