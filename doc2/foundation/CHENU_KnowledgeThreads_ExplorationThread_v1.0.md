# CHE·NU — KNOWLEDGE THREADS (TRIPLE-LAYER SYSTEM)
**VERSION:** FOUNDATION v1.0  
**MODE:** TRUTH-PRESERVING / NON-NARRATIVE / BUILD-READY

---

## GLOBAL PURPOSE

> Knowledge Threads connect information ACROSS time, meetings, agents, spheres, and users

### WITHOUT
- ❌ forcing conclusions
- ❌ collapsing perspectives
- ❌ rewriting history

### RULE
> **Threads CONNECT facts.**  
> **Humans INTERPRET meaning.**

## THREAD TYPE 1 — FACT THREADS

### Purpose
Link objective elements that are proven to exist.

### Sources
- meetings
- decisions
- documents
- XR replays
- agent actions (trace only)

### What it connects
- same artifact appearing multiple times
- same decision referenced later
- same data reused across contexts

### Rules
| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| append-only | ✅ |
| immutable | ✅ |
| hash-verified | ✅ |
| no semantic labels | ✅ |

### JSON Model

```json
{
  "knowledge_thread": {
    "type": "fact",
    "thread_id": "uuid",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "entity_id": "uuid",
        "entity_type": "meeting|decision|artifact",
        "timestamp": 1712345678,
        "sphere": "business|scholar|xr|..."
      }
    ],
    "hash": "sha256"
  }
}
```

## THREAD TYPE 2 — CONTEXT THREADS

### Purpose
Show HOW the same facts appear in different contexts or environments.

### Sources
- different spheres
- different meeting types
- different user profiles
- different XR presets

### What it connects
- same fact, multiple contexts
- same artifact, different purposes
- same meeting topic, different domains

### Rules
| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| no ranking | ✅ |
| no priority | ✅ |
| no normalization | ✅ |

### JSON Model

```json
{
  "knowledge_thread": {
    "type": "context",
    "thread_id": "uuid",
    "references": [
      {
        "fact_thread_id": "uuid",
        "context": {
          "sphere": "scholar|business",
          "meeting_type": "analysis|creative",
          "view_mode": "2d|xr"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

    "visibility": "private|shared",
    "links": [
      {
        "from": "entity_id",
