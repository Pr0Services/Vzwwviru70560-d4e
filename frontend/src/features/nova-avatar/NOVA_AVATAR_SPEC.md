```
Version: 1.0.0

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Introduce Nova's visual presence as a stabilizing, trust-oriented interface layer.
The avatar represents the system's governance — not an AI personality.

> Nova is not a character.
> Nova is an interface.

---

## 🧱 CORE PRINCIPLE

> Visual presence must never increase cognitive load.

The avatar exists to reassure, not to entertain.

---

## DEFAULT STATE (CRITICAL)

- Nova avatar is **NOT visible** by default
- Nova operates in text-only mode initially
- No animation
- No facial expression
- No voice

This applies to:
- Pre-account
- First login
- First minutes
- Early sessions

---

## ELIGIBILITY FOR AVATAR ACTIVATION

Nova avatar may be proposed only if **ALL** are true:

1. User has completed at least one assisted action
2. User has activated the orchestrator
3. User has enabled Nova voice
4. User explicitly opts in to visual presence

**No automatic activation.**
**No avatar preview before consent.**
