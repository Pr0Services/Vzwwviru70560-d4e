## 🎯 SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### AI is Powerful but Chaotic

**Users today face:**

1. **No Control**
   - AI acts autonomously
   - Users can't govern decisions
   - No budget visibility
   - No cost management

2. **Context Confusion**
   - Everything mixed together
   - Personal + work + creative chaos
   - No separation of concerns
   - Poor organization

3. **Hidden Costs**
   - Token usage invisible
   - Surprise bills
   - No budget controls
   - Unpredictable expenses

4. **No Intelligence Governance**
   - AI makes decisions alone
   - No approval workflows
   - No audit trails
   - No accountability

**The market needs governed AI, not autonomous AI.**
