```

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Provide power users with faster workflows
without breaking governance, consent, or clarity.

> Expert Mode accelerates interaction.
> It never removes safeguards.

---

## 🧱 CORE PRINCIPLE

> Expert Mode removes friction, not rules.

All canonical flows remain:
```
Intention → Proposal → Confirmation → Execution
```

---

## ELIGIBILITY TO ENABLE EXPERT MODE

Expert Mode may be enabled only if **ALL** are true:

1. User has completed multiple assisted actions
2. User has accepted or rejected proposals knowingly
3. Orchestrator is activated
4. User explicitly opts in

**No automatic activation.**

---

## ACTIVATION FLOW

### Location
```
Settings → Interaction → Expert Mode
```

### Nova Explanation (once)
```
"Expert Mode reduces confirmation steps
but never removes governance.
You remain in control."
```

### Buttons
```
[ Enable Expert Mode ]   [ Cancel ]
```

---

## WHAT CHANGES IN EXPERT MODE

### 1. Fewer Confirmations (But Never Zero)

- Repeated actions may skip *explanatory* confirmations
- Final execution confirmation remains mandatory
- Budget, scope, and model visibility remain intact

| Normal Mode | Expert Mode |
|-------------|-------------|
| Explain → Confirm → Execute | Execute-ready proposal → Confirm → Execute |

---

### 2. Keyboard-First Interaction

Expert shortcuts become available:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `⌘/Ctrl + Enter` | Confirm proposal |
| `⌘/Ctrl + Shift + S` | Prepare structured version |
| `⌘/Ctrl + K` | Open command palette |
| `Esc` | Cancel / Dismiss proposal |

**Shortcuts are discoverable but never required.**

---

### 3. Command Palette (Text-Based)

Opens with: `⌘/Ctrl + K`

#### Examples
- "Structure selection"
- "Summarize document"
- "Prepare meeting notes"
- "Compare versions"

#### Rules
- Prepare proposals only
- Never execute directly
- Always show scope & cost before execution

---

### 4. Reduced Nova Verbosity

In Expert Mode:
- Nova explanations are shorter
- No repetition of known concepts
- Warnings still appear for:
  - Scope unlock
  - Budget thresholds
  - Sensitive actions

**Nova remains the governance layer.**

---

### 5. Persistent Preferences

Expert Mode allows:
- Default scope preference
- Default budget preset
- Default model preference (if allowed)

Preferences are:
- Explicit
- Reversible
- Visible

---

## WHAT EXPERT MODE NEVER DOES

- ❌ No silent execution
- ❌ No auto-acceptance
- ❌ No bypass of scope locks
- ❌ No bypass of budget guards
- ❌ No hidden model switching

---

## EXPERT MODE IN MEETINGS

Additional capabilities:
- One-click proposal preparation
- Faster summary drafting
- Live meter always visible

Still forbidden:
- Auto recording
- Auto transcription
- Auto follow-ups

---

## SAFETY NETS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Even in Expert Mode:
- First-time actions always require full confirmation
- New scopes require unlock
- New models require confirmation
- Budget overruns are blocked

---

## EXIT EXPERT MODE

- Can be disabled at any time
- No data or preferences lost
- System immediately returns to standard confirmations

### Nova Message
```
"Expert Mode disabled. All safeguards remain active."
```

---

## UX CONSTRAINTS

- Expert Mode is never advertised
- No badges or gamification
- No superiority framing
- Calm, professional tone only

---

## CANONICAL STATEMENT

```
"Expert Mode accelerates interaction.
It never accelerates risk."
```

---

```
END OF SPECIFICATION
