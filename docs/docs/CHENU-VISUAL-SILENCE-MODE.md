# CHE·NU — Visual Silence Mode + Decision Echo × Temporal Braiding

## 📜 Overview

**Status:** OBSERVATIONAL CLARITY LAYER  
**Authority:** NONE  
**Intent:** PRESERVE MEANING BY REDUCING NOISE

This combined system exists to allow moments where the system deliberately steps back, showing **LESS** in order to reveal **MORE**.

---

## 🎯 Core Intent

| Supports | Never Supports |
|----------|----------------|
| ✅ Reflection | ❌ Acceleration |
| ✅ Memory reading | ❌ Optimization |
| ✅ Orientation in time | ❌ Guidance |
| | ❌ Pressure to act |

---

## 🤫 Visual Silence Mode (VSM)

### Purpose

Reduce visual, semantic, and cognitive load when interpretation or reflection is needed.

Visual Silence Mode answers only:
> "What remains when noise is removed?"

---

### What VSM Does When Activated

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Hides suggestions | ✅ |
| Hides highlights | ✅ |
| Hides preference cues | ✅ |
| Hides comparative emphasis | ✅ |
| Hides urgency indicators | ✅ |

**Only core factual structures remain visible.**

---

### What Remains Visible

| Element | Presentation |
|---------|--------------|
| Timelines | Neutral |
| Narrative markers | Visible |
| Decision echoes | Static |
| Context labels | Text-only |
| Navigation affordances | Minimal |

---

### What is FORBIDDEN

| Forbidden | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Animations implying direction | Creates pressure |
| Glow effects | Draws attention |
| Color emphasis | Creates hierarchy |
| Pulse animations | Creates urgency |
| Call-to-action language | Pressures action |
| Ranking/ordering cues | Implies judgment |

**Silence is not emptiness. It is intentional restraint.**

---

## 🔔 Decision Echo × Temporal Braiding

### Overlay Principle

Decision Echoes are placed **ON** braided timelines as **immutable markers**.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Placed on braided timelines | ✅ |
| As immutable markers | ✅ |
| Connects strands | ❌ Never |
| Redirects flow | ❌ Never |

---

### What the Overlay Shows

| Shows | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Which decision occurred | ✅ |
| When it occurred | ✅ |
| In which context strand | ✅ |
| Alongside other strands | ✅ |

| Never Shows | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Arrows | ❌ |
| Before/after emphasis | ❌ |
| Narrative synthesis | ❌ |

---

### What It NEVER Shows

| Never Shows | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Outcomes | No causality implied |
| Consequences | No judgment |
| Success or failure | No evaluation |
| Inferred impact | No prediction |

---

## ⏱️ Temporal Braiding Rules (Reinforced)

| Rule | Enforced |
|------|----------|
| Each strand retains autonomy | ✅ |
| Decision echoes don't dominate visual space | ✅ |
| Overlapping allowed without merge | ✅ |
| Silence mode prevents automatic alignment | ✅ |

**Time remains plural.**

---

## 👤 User Interaction Rules

### User MAY:

| Action | Allowed |
|--------|---------|
| Toggle Visual Silence Mode at any time | ✅ |
| Enter silence without exiting session | ✅ |
| Inspect individual echoes | ✅ |
| Pan across braided timelines | ✅ |

### User may NOT:

| Action | Forbidden |
|--------|-----------|
| Annotate echoes publicly | ❌ |
| Modify markers | ❌ |
| Trigger actions from this view | ❌ |

---

## 🥽 XR / Universe View

In XR:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Environment dims | Visual Silence dims the environment |
| Strands slow/still | Animation reduces or stops |
| Echoes as landmarks | Decision echoes appear as fixed landmarks |

**User moves through time, time does not move toward the user.**

---

## 🛡️ Failsafes

| Failsafe | Enforced |
|----------|----------|
| Silence mode never times out automatically | ✅ |
| Silence mode disables background learning | ✅ |
| Silence mode disables narrative generation | ✅ |
| Silence mode is never suggested proactively | ✅ |

---

## 📜 System Declaration

```
Visual Silence exists to protect meaning.

Decision Echo within braided time exists
to preserve memory without creating destiny.

Nothing here tells the user what to do.
Nothing here implies what should have been done.

Clarity is allowed to emerge.
Responsibility remains human.
```
