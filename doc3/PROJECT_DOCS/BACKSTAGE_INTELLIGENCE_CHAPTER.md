# BACKSTAGE INTELLIGENCE â€” COMPLETE SPECIFICATION

## Chapter 109: Backstage Intelligence Overview

### Introduction

Backstage Intelligence represents CHEÂ·NU's invisible cognitive layerâ€”the silent, watchful system that performs essential background operations without interrupting user flow. While users interact with visible interfaces and agents, Backstage Intelligence works behind the scenes: analyzing context, preparing content, classifying information, routing data, enforcing safety, and optimizing operations.

### Definition

Backstage Intelligence is NOT an agent that users interact with directly. It is the foundational intelligence infrastructure that makes all other CHEÂ·NU components more effective. It observes, prepares, classifies, routes, validates, and optimizesâ€”but never generates visible content or takes autonomous action without explicit workflow activation or user permission.

### Core Philosophy

Backstage Intelligence embodies the principle of **invisible competence**. Just as a well-run organization has unseen operational excellence enabling front-line success, CHEÂ·NU's Backstage Intelligence creates the conditions for productive user experiences without demanding attention or recognition.

### Behavioral Principles

**Predictability**: Backstage Intelligence behaves consistently and predictably. Users can understand and anticipate its operations.

**Invisibility**: Normal operations occur without user awareness. Only exceptions or required approvals surface to user attention.

**Safety-First**: When uncertain, Backstage Intelligence errs on the side of caution, requesting permission rather than acting.

**Governance Compliance**: Every operation respects CHEÂ·NU's governance framework, particularly identity boundaries and permission requirements.

## Chapter 110: Core Responsibilities

### A. Context Analysis

Backstage Intelligence continuously analyzes operational context:

**Sphere Detection**: Identifying which sphere (Personal, Enterprise, Creative, etc.) is relevant to current activity.

**Domain Detection**: Determining which domains (Construction, Finance, Immobilier, etc.) apply to the content or task.

**Thread Relevance**: Connecting current activity to related conversation threads and history.

**Intent Extraction**: Interpreting user goals from actions, language, and patterns.

**Identity Recognition**: Determining active identity and associated permissions.

**Workspace Interpretation**: Understanding workspace layout and content relationships.

**File Semantics**: Detecting file types and their semantic meaning in context.

### B. Data Preparation

Before content reaches users or agents, Backstage Intelligence prepares it:

**Text Normalization**: Cleaning and standardizing text formatting.

**Metadata Extraction**: Pulling relevant metadata from files and content.

**Entity Detection**: Identifying projects, tasks, deadlines, people, properties, amounts.

**Summary Preparation**: Creating summary fragments for agents to use.

**Missing Context Identification**: Flagging gaps that may require user input.

**Structure Detection**: Recognizing tables, lists, sections, and relationships.

### C. Classification

Backstage Intelligence categorizes incoming information:

**Document Classification**: Categorizing documents by type, domain, and purpose.

**Task Classification**: Sorting tasks by domain (meeting, immobilier, construction, finance).

**Media Classification**: Categorizing images, videos, and audio by content and relevance.

**XR Object Classification**: Organizing 3D assets and spatial data.

**DataSpace Targeting**: Suggesting appropriate DataSpace destinations.

**Domain Opportunity Detection**: Identifying when content could benefit from domain specialization.

### D. Routing

Information flows to correct destinations through Backstage Intelligence:

**File to DataSpace**: Routing uploaded files to appropriate DataSpaces.

**Thread to Domain**: Directing conversations to relevant domain contexts.

**Notes to Meeting**: Channeling meeting notes to Meeting DataSpaces.

**Immobilier Artifacts**: Routing property documents to correct property cards.

**Renovation Content**: Directing renovation materials to Construction and Architecture domains.

**Task to Sphere**: Ensuring tasks reach the appropriate sphere context.

### E. Risk Detection

Backstage Intelligence identifies potential problems:

**Permission Gaps**: Detecting when required permissions are missing.

**Identity Conflicts**: Identifying actions that would cross identity boundaries.

**Unsafe Cross-Sphere Actions**: Flagging operations that inappropriately mix spheres.

**Data Leakage Attempts**: Detecting attempts to move data outside proper boundaries.

**Incomplete Workflows**: Identifying workflows missing required steps.

**Agent Overreach**: Detecting when agents attempt unauthorized actions.

**Logic Inconsistencies**: Finding contradictions in data or decisions.

### F. Safety Enforcement

Backstage Intelligence enforces protective boundaries:

**Memory Blocking**: Preventing unauthorized content from entering memory.

**Cross-Identity Protection**: Blocking data movement between identities.

**Agent Access Control**: Enforcing agent permission boundaries.

## Chapter 111: Governance Framework

### Mandatory Governance Principles

Backstage Intelligence operates under strict governance rules:

1. **No Unsupervised Action**: Every operation is defined by explicit rules or workflows.

2. **No Hidden Memory**: Nothing enters persistent memory without user awareness.

3. **No Unauthorized Routing**: Data moves only through approved pathways.

4. **No Cross-Identity Access**: Identity boundaries are inviolable.

5. **No Speculative Output**: Background work never produces visible results without workflow activation.

6. **Irreversible Change Protection**: Permanent changes require explicit permission.

7. **Transparent Logging**: All operations logged and auditable.

8. **Reversibility**: All background actions can be undone.

9. **Identity-Scoped Visibility**: Backstage Intelligence sees only what the active identity can see.

10. **Safety Over Speed**: When uncertain, prioritize safety over efficiency.

### Elevation Requests

When Backstage Intelligence needs higher permissions, it triggers an Elevation Request:

**Components of Elevation Request**:
- Clear explanation of the situation
- Specific data access needed
- Proposed action to take
- Potential risks and alternatives
- Required permission level
- Explicit confirmation mechanism

**User Response Options**:
- Approve: Grant permission for this action
- Approve Always: Grant permanent permission for this type
- Deny: Refuse permission
- Modify: Adjust the proposed action

## Chapter 117: Backstage Intelligence Glossary

**Backstage Intelligence**: CHEÂ·NU's invisible cognitive layer performing background operations.

**Context Analysis**: The process of understanding sphere, domain, and intent from user activity.

**Data Preparation**: Processing raw content into structured, usable formats.

**Classification**: Categorizing content by type, domain, and purpose.

**Routing**: Directing content to appropriate DataSpaces and domains.

**Risk Detection**: Identifying potential problems before they occur.

**Safety Enforcement**: Blocking unauthorized or unsafe operations.

**Elevation Request**: A request for user approval when higher permissions are needed.

**Identity Scoping**: Restricting operations to the active identity context.

**Optimization**: Improving system performance through preparation and caching.

**Governed Visibility**: The principle that Backstage Intelligence sees only what identity permits.

**Invisible Competence**: The design philosophy of effective background operation without user awareness.
