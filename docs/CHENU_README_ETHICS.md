# CHE·NU

## Ethical Foundation

CHE·NU is built on a frozen ethical foundation that governs all system behavior.

### Core Principles

- No agent makes decisions on behalf of users
- No moral judgment or scoring is performed
- No behavioral nudging or silent optimization occurs
- Responsibility always remains human
- The system is co-responsible for clarity, never for choice
- All assistance is explicit, voluntary, and reversible
- Silence mode disables all analysis and observation
- Observable consequences may be shown, never evaluated

### Ethics Checkpoints

Ethics Checkpoints are structural moments where the system makes human responsibility explicit.

**Properties:**
- Non-intrusive
- Optional and ignorable
- Never blocking
- Never judging
- Never persisting state

**Locations (4 only):**
- Task creation
- Context or sphere change
- XR or meeting activation
- Replay, export, or publication

**Heavy workflows** (multiple agents, cross-sphere data, persistent output, XR involvement) may also trigger a checkpoint. Light workflows never do.

**Icon:** 🧭 (Compass — orientation without judgment)

### Immutability

This ethical foundation is:
- Versioned
- Hashed (SHA-256)
- Auditable

It applies to the core system, all agents, all spheres, XR extensions, and all future development. Any evolution must remain compatible with this foundation.
