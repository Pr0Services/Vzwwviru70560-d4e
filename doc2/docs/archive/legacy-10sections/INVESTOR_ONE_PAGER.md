# CHE·NU™ ONE-PAGER
## Governed Intelligence Operating System

**Confidential Executive Summary | December 2024**

---

## COMPANY OVERVIEW

**CHE·NU** is building the first **Governed Intelligence Operating System** — a revolutionary platform that puts users in complete control of AI operations. Unlike autonomous AI tools that act independently, CHE·NU governs every AI decision through approval workflows, budget controls, and transparent cost management.

We're solving the critical problem of AI chaos: today's users have no visibility into AI costs, no control over AI actions, and no way to organize AI work across different life contexts. CHE·NU provides **8 distinct spheres** (Personal, Business, Creative, etc.) with a consistent **Bureau structure**, a proprietary **encoding layer** that reduces token costs by 30-50%, and a **token economy** that makes AI expenses visible and manageable. We're creating a new category in enterprise and consumer AI: **governed intelligence platforms**.

## THE PROBLEM

**AI users today face four critical challenges:**

1. **No Control:** AI acts autonomously with no approval workflows or governance
2. **Context Chaos:** Personal, work, and creative tasks all mixed together  
3. **Hidden Costs:** Token usage invisible, leading to surprise bills and no budget management
4. **No Accountability:** No audit trails, no decision tracking, no transparency

**The market desperately needs governed AI, not just more powerful autonomous AI.**

---

## OUR SOLUTION

**CHE·NU provides five core capabilities:**

✅ **Governed Execution** – Users approve every AI action before execution  
✅ **Context Separation** – 8 spheres keep life organized (Personal, Business, Creative, etc.)  
✅ **Cost Transparency** – Token economy shows exactly what AI costs in real-time  
✅ **Version Control** – Every change tracked, compare any versions, rollback instantly  
✅ **Agent Orchestration** – 168 hierarchical agents working under user governance

**Unique Technology:** Proprietary encoding layer (30-50% token savings), Bureau Model (consistent 10-section structure), and Governed Execution Pipeline (10-step AI governance process).
