   - Agent assignment
   - Status indicators

**Action:**
- Click "Approve" on one item
- Show status change to "Approved"
- Point out token deduction

**Say:**
> "Notice how every action requires approval. We track tokens, we show costs, we give you control. This is governed AI, not autonomous AI."

- "Never lose work again"
- "Full audit trail for compliance"
- "Compare any two points in time"

---

### **ACT 3: AGENT ORCHESTRATION (90 seconds)**

**Show:**
1. Click "Agents" in header
2. Display agent monitor
3. Show agent grid/list with:
   - Agent names
   - Status indicators (active/idle)
   - Token usage
   - Success rates
4. Click on one agent to expand
5. Show agent details:
   - Recent tasks
   - Performance graph
   - Cost breakdown

**Action:**
- Show real-time activity (if possible)
- Point out budget limits
- Highlight cost efficiency

**Say:**
> "This is unprecedented visibility. You see exactly what each agent does, what it costs, and how well it performs. You control the orchestra, not the individual instruments."

**Talking Points:**
- "168 agents, all governed"

## 💬 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q: Is this a prototype or production code?**
**A:** "This is production code. We've written ~15,000 lines of TypeScript/React with full test coverage. Everything you saw works reliably."

**A:** "Fully responsive. The same codebase works on desktop, tablet, and mobile. We can show you the mobile view if you'd like."

### **Q: How does the token economy work?**
**A:** "Tokens represent AI computation costs. Users buy tokens, allocate them to tasks, and we track every token spent. Full transparency, no surprises."

### **Q: What's your tech stack?**
**A:** "React and TypeScript frontend, Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, WebXR for future immersive features. Modern, scalable, proven."

## 🔄 BACKUP SCENARIOS

### **If Demo Mode Breaks:**
- Skip it, continue with main demo
- Say: "We have an interactive demo mode, but let's focus on the core features today."

### **If Version Compare is Slow:**
- Show version list only
- Say: "The diff view loads large files beautifully. Here's the version history at a glance."

### **If Search is Laggy:**
- Navigate manually
- Say: "Search is instant once we have production data volume. Let me navigate directly."

### **If Any Component Crashes:**
- Refresh browser immediately
- Say: "Let me refresh — this is a live environment, not a scripted demo."
