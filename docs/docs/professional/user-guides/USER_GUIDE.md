## Getting Started

### What is CHE·NU?

CHE·NU™ is a **Governed Intelligence Operating System** that helps you manage your digital life with AI assistance. Think of it as your personal workspace where AI agents help you with tasks, organize information, and make better decisions.

**CHE·NU is NOT:**
- ❌ A simple chatbot
- ❌ Just another productivity app
- ❌ A social network

**CHE·NU IS:**
- ✅ A complete operating system for your digital life
- ✅ Your personal AI workspace with governance
- ✅ A platform that **puts you in control** of AI

### Key Concepts

Before we dive in, let's understand three core concepts:

#### 1. **Spheres** 🌍

Spheres are **contexts** for different parts of your life. Each sphere is a complete workspace:

```
🏠 Personal          → Your personal life
💼 Business          → Your work and professional activities
🏛️ Government        → Civic and institutional matters
🎨 Studio            → Creative projects
👥 Community         → Community engagement
📱 Social & Media    → Social interactions
🎬 Entertainment     → Leisure and entertainment
🤝 My Team           → Team collaboration
📚 Scholar           → Learning and research
```

**Why separate spheres?**
- Clarity: One context at a time = less cognitive load
- Organization: Everything in its right place
- Privacy: Keep work and personal separate
- Focus: Eliminate distractions

#### 2. **Bureaus** 📋

Each sphere opens a **Bureau** with the same structure:

1. **Dashboard** → Overview and quick actions
2. **Notes** → Capture thoughts and ideas
3. **Tasks** → Things to do
4. **Projects** → Long-term initiatives
5. **Threads** → Conversations and collaboration
6. **Meetings** → Schedule and notes
7. **Data** → Files and databases
8. **Agents** → AI assistants for this sphere
9. **Reports** → Analytics and insights
10. **Budget** → Token usage and governance

**Why the same structure?**
- Consistency: Learn once, use everywhere
- Muscle memory: Navigate faster
- Predictability: Always know where things are

#### 3. **Threads** 💬

Threads are **conversations with AI** that:
- Persist over time
- Have context and memory
- Cost tokens (managed by you)
- Can involve multiple agents
- Are fully auditable

**Think of threads like:**
- A conversation with an expert consultant
- A project workspace with AI collaboration
- A persistent line of thought that evolves

## Your First Steps

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [https://chenu.com/signup](https://chenu.com/signup)
2. Enter your email and create a strong password
3. Verify your email
4. **Enable MFA** (highly recommended!)

**Why MFA?**
- Protects your account from unauthorized access
- Required for enterprise features
- Takes only 30 seconds to set up

**How to enable MFA:**
1. Go to Settings → Security
2. Click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Scan QR code with Google Authenticator (or similar app)
4. Enter the 6-digit code to verify
5. **Save your backup codes** in a safe place!

### Step 2: Take the Tour

When you first login, you'll see the **Interactive Tour**. We highly recommend taking it! It covers:
- Sphere navigation
- Creating your first thread
- Working with Nova (system intelligence)
- Basic governance concepts

**Tour duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Skip it?** You can always restart it from Help → Interactive Tour

### Step 3: Customize Your Workspace

**Choose your theme:**
- Settings → Appearance → Light / Dark mode

**Set your preferences:**
- Settings → Preferences
  - Default sphere (where you start)
  - Notification preferences
  - Language
  - Timezone

**Connect integrations:**
- Settings → Integrations
  - Google Calendar
  - Slack
  - Email
  - Others...

## Working with Spheres

### Switching Between Spheres

**Method 1: Sphere Navigator (Left Sidebar)**
- Click on any sphere icon to switch
- Active sphere is highlighted

**Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut**
```
⌘/Ctrl + 1  →  Personal
⌘/Ctrl + 2  →  Business
⌘/Ctrl + 3  →  Government
⌘/Ctrl + 4  →  Studio
⌘/Ctrl + 5  →  Community
⌘/Ctrl + 6  →  Social & Media
⌘/Ctrl + 7  →  Entertainment
⌘/Ctrl + 8  →  My Team
⌘/Ctrl + 9  →  Scholar
```

**Method 3: Quick Switcher**
- Press `⌘/Ctrl + K`
- Type sphere name
- Press Enter

### Understanding Sphere States

Each sphere shows its current state:

**Active** (highlighted)
- Currently open and visible
- All bureau sections available

**Inactive** (dim)
- Not currently open
- Click to activate

**Notification badge**
- Shows unread count
- Red = urgent
- Blue = informational

### Best Practices for Sphere Use

✅ **DO:**
- Keep one sphere active at a time
- Close a sphere when done (focuses attention)
- Use the right sphere for the right task
- Review each sphere daily

❌ **DON'T:**
- Mix personal and business in same sphere
- Keep all spheres open (cognitive overload)
- Ignore notification badges (info decay)
- Use wrong sphere (confuses AI context)

## Managing Threads

### What Are Threads?

Threads are persistent conversations with AI. Unlike a simple chat, threads:

1. **Maintain context** across sessions
2. **Have budgets** (tokens you allocate)
3. **Record decisions** and outcomes
4. **Are auditable** (full history)
5. **Can involve multiple agents**

### Creating a Thread

**From Bureau:**
1. Navigate to desired sphere
2. Click "Threads" in bureau
3. Click "New Thread" button
4. Fill in details:
   - **Title**: Brief, descriptive name
   - **Description**: What you want to accomplish
   - **Budget**: Token allocation (suggested: 1000)
   - **Agents**: Which AI assistants to involve

**Quick Create:**
- Press `⌘/Ctrl + N`
- Type title
- Press Enter

**Example Thread:**
```
Title: Q1 Marketing Campaign Planning
Description: Plan and execute our Q1 2026 marketing campaign 
for product launch. Need strategy, timeline, and budget.
Sphere: Business
Budget: 5000 tokens
Agents: Nova, Marketing Specialist
```

### Thread Anatomy

### Specialist Agents

Specialist agents are experts in specific domains:

**Available Specialists:**
- 📊 Data Analyst

- 🔍 Research Assistant
- 📱 Social Media Manager

**How to use specialists:**

2. Or assign them when creating thread
3. They respond with expertise
4. Cost varies by complexity

**Example:**
```
You: @DataAnalyst Can you analyze our Q4 sales data?

DataAnalyst: I'll analyze your Q4 sales data. Processing...

⚠️  Churn Rate: 3.2% (above target of 2.5%)

Recommendations:
1. Focus retention in January (post-holiday)

Would you like me to deep-dive into any area?
