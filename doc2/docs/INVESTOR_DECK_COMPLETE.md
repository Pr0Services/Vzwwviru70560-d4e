# CHE·NU

### A Sovereign Multi-Agent Operating Space for Humans

---

**Vision**

- Multi-sphere system for life, work, and institutions
- Coherent structure instead of fragmented apps
- Built to scale ethically and visually (2D → XR)

**Tagline**

> *"Your universe. Your rules. Your clarity."*

---

# The Problem

---

### Fragmentation & Opacity

- **Life and work are scattered** across platforms, tools, and identities
- **AI is often opaque**, centralized, and manipulative by design
- Users lack a **coherent structure** for decisions, memory, and collaboration
- Institutions **fear AI** because of ethics, trust, and control concerns

---

### The Current State

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Scattered tools | Cognitive overload |
| Opaque AI | Loss of trust |
| No unified memory | Repeated context |
| Centralized authority | Dependency risk |
| Hidden optimization | Behavioral manipulation |

---

# The Opportunity

---

### A New Paradigm

- **Structure** the way humans and agents collaborate across spheres
- Provide a **transparent, navigable "personal universe"** (CHE·NU)
- Offer AI that **clarifies instead of deciding**
- Enable **responsible multi-agent systems** for individuals, teams, institutions

---

### Market Timing

| Trend | CHE·NU Position |
|-------|-----------------|
| AI adoption surge | Ethical differentiation |
| Privacy concerns rising | Sovereignty by design |
| XR emerging | Native spatial readiness |
| Enterprise AI caution | Trust-first architecture |
| Regulatory pressure | Compliance-ready core |

---

# What is CHE·NU?

---

### Definition

**CHE·NU** (pronounced "Chez Nous" — *"Our Home"*)

A **multi-sphere operating space** where:

- Humans retain sovereignty over AI agents
- Structure replaces chaos
- Clarity replaces manipulation
- Memory and context persist across domains

---

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Trunk** | Core laws, governance, ethics |
| **Spheres** | Life domains (Personal, Business, Social…) |
| **Agents** | Specialized assistants under human control |
| **Methodologies** | Pluggable analytical frameworks |
| **XR Layer** | Spatial navigation and collaboration |

---

# Architecture

### Trunk & Spheres

---

### The Trunk

The **immutable core** that governs all operations:

- **Tree Laws** — Constitutional principles
- **Ethics Module** — Frozen ethical foundation
- **Orchestration** — Agent coordination
- **Methodology Engine** — Analytical frameworks
- **PTC System** — Pre-Approved Task Contexts

---

### The Spheres

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ROOT[Trunk<br/>Core Laws & Governance]
    ROOT --> SPHERES[Spheres Layer]
    SPHERES --> PERSONAL[Personal]
    SPHERES --> BUSINESS[Business]
    SPHERES --> SOCIAL[Social & Media]
    SPHERES --> SCHOLAR[Scholar]
    SPHERES --> CREATIVE[Creative Studio]
    SPHERES --> INSTITUTIONS[Institutions]
    SPHERES --> XR[XR / Spatial]
```

---

### Sphere Details

| Sphere | Domain | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Personal** | Private life | Health, finance, relationships |
| **Business** | Professional | Projects, contracts, compliance |
| **Social & Media** | Public presence | Content, reputation, networks |
| **Scholar** | Knowledge | Research, learning, certifications |
| **Creative** | Expression | Design, writing, media production |
| **Institutions** | Governance | Policies, audits, public services |
| **XR** | Spatial | Meetings, visualization, collaboration |

---

# Multi-Agent System

---

### Agent Architecture

CHE·NU employs a **hierarchical multi-agent system**:

| Level | Role | Count |
|-------|------|-------|
| L0 | Core orchestration | 1 |
| L1 | Sphere coordinators | 8 |
| L2 | Domain specialists | 24 |
| L3 | Task executors | 135+ |

**Total:** 168+ specialized agents

---

### Agent Principles

Every agent operates under strict contracts:

```
✓ Agents NEVER decide for users
✓ All delegation is voluntary
✓ Every chain passes through the user
✓ Silence mode overrides all agents
✓ Replay is read-only
```

---

### Agent Contract Example

| Agent | Does | Never Does |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Analysis** | Describe, organize, summarize | Decide, recommend, judge |
| **Methodology** | Present frameworks, explain options | Choose, prioritize, impose |
| **Comparison** | Compare factually, highlight differences | Judge, prefer, conclude |
| **Presentation** | Format, structure, visualize | Modify meaning, persuade |

---

### Multi-Agent Workflows

```mermaid

    A[User initiates task] --> B{Workflow declared}
    B -->|Light task| C[Execute silently]
    B -->|Heavy task| D[Multi-Agent Workflow]

    G --> H{User Decision}
    H -->|Accept| I[Finalize]
    H -->|Modify| J[Iterate]
    H -->|Reject| K[Cancel]
```

# Ethics by Architecture

---

### The Problem with AI Ethics Today

| Approach | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Policy-based | Can be overridden |
| Training-based | Opaque, inconsistent |
| Filter-based | Reactive, not structural |
| Audit-based | Post-hoc, not preventive |

**CHE·NU takes a different path:**

> Ethics frozen at the **architectural level**

---

### Frozen Ethical Foundation

```
CHE·NU is a system centered on human sovereignty.

No agent makes decisions on behalf of users.
No moral judgment is performed.
No ideological or behavioral standard is imposed.

Responsibility always remains human.
The system is co-responsible for clarity, never for choice.

All assistance is explicit, voluntary, and reversible.
Silence mode disables all analysis and observation.
```

**SHA-256:** `1122494114f55449991abca77eccf0324b89d6df79b3183e13459730bb97be7d`

---

### What This Means

| Traditional AI | CHE·NU |
|----------------|--------|
| Decides for users | Clarifies for users |
| Hidden optimization | Transparent assistance |
| Behavioral nudging | Neutral presentation |
| Moral authority | Human sovereignty |
| Trust us | Verify us |

---

### Co-Responsibility Model

**User Responsibilities:**
- Define intent
- Set boundaries
- Make decisions
- Accept outcomes

**System Responsibilities:**
- Increase clarity
- Show consequences (factually)
- Signal misalignment (non-judgmentally)
- Preserve sovereignty

---

# Ethics Checkpoints

---

### What is an Ethics Checkpoint?

An **Ethics Checkpoint** (🧭) is a **structural moment** where the system makes explicit:

- The active frame (PTC + context)
- Human responsibility
- The possibility to reflect or ignore

It does **NOT**:
- Block anything
- Judge anything
- Decide anything

---

### Checkpoint Locations

Only **4 locations** are authorized:

| Location | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| **Task Init** | Creating a new task |
| **Context Change** | Switching spheres |
| **XR Meeting** | Entering spatial collaboration |
| **Replay/Export** | Publishing or sharing |

**No other checkpoint exists.**

---

### Workflow Checkpoint Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Action] --> B{Load Level?}
    B -->|Light| C[Silent Execution]
    B -->|Heavy| D{Conditions Met?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E[🧭 Ethics Checkpoint]
    E --> F[User Acknowledges]
    F --> G[Workflow Proceeds]
    G --> H[Result Delivered]
```

---

### Checkpoint Activation Conditions

Heavy workflow checkpoint triggers **only if**:

```
loadLevel === "heavy"
AND (
  agentCount > 1
  OR crossesSpheres === true
  OR producesPersistentOutput === true
  OR xrInvolved === true
)
```

**Light workflows = ZERO friction**

---

### Checkpoint Content

**Strictly authorized:**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Icon | 🧭 |
| Message | "Multi-agent workflow active · Human responsibility maintained" |
| Subtext | "Multiple agents cooperate within a frame you defined." |

**No warnings. No judgments. No alerts.**
