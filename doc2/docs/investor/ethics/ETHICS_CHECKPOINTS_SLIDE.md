# Ethics Checkpoints — Responsibility by Architecture

---

## The Problem

Most AI platforms:

- embed ethics as policies
- enforce rules silently
- optimize behavior without awareness

This creates:

- loss of trust
- regulatory tension
- user disengagement

---

## Our Solution

CHE·NU introduces **Ethics Checkpoints**.

Not rules.
Not approvals.
Not controls.

But **structural moments of clarity**.

---

## Definition

An Ethics Checkpoint is a non-intrusive system moment where:

- the active context is made explicit
- responsibility remains human
- reflection is optional

**No blocking.**
**No scoring.**
**No judgment.**

---

## Placement

Ethics Checkpoints appear only at:

- task creation
- context or sphere change
- XR / meeting activation
- replay, export or publication

**Always visible.**
**Always ignorable.**

---

## Key Takeaway

> CHE·NU is not an AI that tells users what to do.
> It is a system that ensures users always know what they are doing.

---

## Visual Identity

**Icon:** 🧭 Compass

**Meaning:**
- orientation without prohibition
- direction without judgment
- human sovereignty
