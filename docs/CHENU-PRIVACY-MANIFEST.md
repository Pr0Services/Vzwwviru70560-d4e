# CHE·NU — Privacy Manifest
### Human dignity before data value

---

## Our Promise

CHE·NU is built on a simple belief:

**Personal data is not fuel.  
Privacy is not a feature.  
Human dignity is not negotiable.**

---

## What "Personal Data" Means to Us

Personal data includes anything that can:
- identify you
- describe you
- be linked back to you
- infer something about you

If it touches a human life — it is protected.

---

## Our Default Rule

**Your data is private by default.**

No hidden sharing.  
No silent collection.  
No "you agreed without knowing".

Access only happens when **you explicitly choose it**.

---

## No Surveillance, No Profiling

CHE·NU does **not**:
- track emotions
- profile personalities
- score productivity
- infer psychological traits
- monitor behavior in the background

We refuse to turn humans into signals.

---

## Your Data Belongs to You

You can:
- read your data
- export it
- delete it
- take it with you

When data leaves CHE·NU, it loses all system power.
It is **yours**, not ours.

---

## Agents Serve — They Do Not Watch

AI agents in CHE·NU:
- act only within explicit scope
- cannot access personal data silently
- forget what they are not allowed to keep
- must declare when data is touched

They assist.  
They do not observe in secret.

---

## Collective Insight Without Individual Pressure

When CHE·NU observes patterns at scale:
- individuals are never identifiable
- no group can be targeted
- no action can be enforced

Awareness without leverage.

---

## Law Is the Floor — Not the Ceiling

CHE·NU is designed to align with:
- GDPR (Europe)
- CCPA / CPRA (California)
- PIPEDA (Canada)

If the law allows less protection than we promise,
**we choose the higher standard.**

---

## Our Final Commitment

If a feature requires violating privacy,
**that feature does not belong in CHE·NU.**

Privacy is not a tradeoff.  
It is a foundation.

*CHE·NU — Building unity without surveillance.*

❤️ With love, for humanity.
