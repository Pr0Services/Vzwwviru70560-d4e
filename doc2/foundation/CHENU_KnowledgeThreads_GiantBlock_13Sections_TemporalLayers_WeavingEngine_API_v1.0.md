# CHE·NU — KNOWLEDGE THREADS SYSTEM
**VERSION:** KT.v1.0  
**MODE:** FOUNDATION / CROSS-SPHERE / IMMERSIVE / NON-MANIPULATIVE

---

## I. KNOWLEDGE THREADS — CORE CONCEPT ⚡

### Purpose
Link facts, decisions, artifacts, replays, agents, and contexts into **navigable threads WITHOUT interpretation or influence.**

> **Knowledge Thread = Chain of verifiable knowledge fragments.**

### RULE
> **THREAD = FACTS ONLY. NO interpretation. NO conclusion. NO recommendation. NO emotional metadata.**

### Thread Element Types ⚡
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FACT_NODE` | validated data, timestamped, origin: replay/document/meeting ⚡ |
| `ARTIFACT_NODE` | board, file, image, visual note ⚡ |
| `DECISION_NODE` | declared outcome, **no judgment tags** ⚡ |
| `EVENT_NODE` | actions or non-actions ⚡ |
| `AGENT_NODE` | **participation trace only** ⚡ |
| `CONTEXT_NODE` | sphere, meeting type, participants ⚡ |

### Thread Relationships ⚡
| Relation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FOLLOWS_FROM` | ⚡ |
| `REFERENCES` | ⚡ |
| `DEPENDS_ON` | ⚡ |
| `OCCURRED_BEFORE` | ⚡ |
| `PART_OF` | ⚡ |
| `LINKED_TO` | ⚡ |

---

## II. CROSS-SPHERE KNOWLEDGE THREADS ⚡

### Purpose
Reveal how knowledge flows between spheres **WITHOUT blending them or forcing interpretation.**

### Threads MAY ⚡
| Allowed | Status |
|---------|--------|

| **shape decisions** | ❌ ⚡ |

### Cross-Sphere Rules ⚡
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **A) ORIGIN SPHERE ANCHOR** | Every thread has a primary sphere ⚡ |
| **B) SECONDARY SPHERES** | Branch if decision affects multiple, artifact reused, meeting spans domains ⚡ |
| **C) VISIBILITY** | Users only see links they have permission for ⚡ |
| **D) AGENT BEHAVIOR** | **Agents never infer or generate meaning** ⚡ |

---

## III. TEMPORAL KNOWLEDGE THREADS ⚡

### Purpose
Organize knowledge over time as **evolving timelines.**

### 4 Temporal Layers ⚡ (NOUVEAU!)
| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| **LAYER 2 — ARTIFACT TIMELINE** | How knowledge objects evolved ⚡ |
| **LAYER 3 — DECISION TIMELINE** | Sequence of choices ⚡ |
| **LAYER 4 — THREAD HISTORY** | **How the thread itself transformed** ⚡ |

### Temporal Rules ⚡
| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| **no time compression** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **no "key moment" ranking** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **no narrative shaping** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **no predictive modeling** | ✅ ⚡ |

### Temporal Features ⚡
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `jump_to(date)` | ⚡ |
| `timeline diff mode` | ⚡ |
| `multi-thread braid view` | ⚡ |
| `silence visualization` | ⚡ |
| `"thread density" (factual count only)` | ⚡ |

## IV. PERSONAL vs COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE THREADS ⚡

### Collective Thread ⚡
| Property | Description |

### Personal Thread ⚡
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| user notes | ⚡ |
| highlights | ⚡ |
| bookmarks | ⚡ |
| **private interpretations (OPTIONAL, private only)** | ⚡ |

### Thread Merge Rules ⚡
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **PERSONAL → NEVER merged automatically** | ⚡ |
| **COLLECTIVE → canonical truth log** | ⚡ |

> User may choose to publish or merge manually.

### Logic ⚡
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| IF event references artifact | → link ⚡ |
| IF decision references fact | → link ⚡ |
| IF replay contains sequence | → chain ⚡ |
| IF agent participates | → attach node ⚡ |
| IF cross-sphere | → **add boundary marker** ⚡ |

### NO ⚡
| Forbidden | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| inference | ❌ ⚡ |
| causal analysis | ❌ ⚡ |
| optimization | ❌ ⚡ |
| predictive linking | ❌ ⚡ |
