# CHE·NU — KNOWLEDGE THREADS v1.0
**MODE:** FOUNDATION / NON-MANIPULATIVE / MULTI-SPHERE

---

## PURPOSE ⚡

> **Knowledge Threads = factual connections woven across:** spheres, meetings, replays, artifacts, decisions, agents, user memories (optional visibility).

### RULE
> **Threads REVEAL STRUCTURE, not meaning. They do NOT rank, interpret, or suggest conclusions.**

## 4 THREAD TYPES ⚡

### 1) FACTUAL THREADS (CORE TRUTH LINKS) ⚡

### Description
> **Connects events, documents, decisions, or replays based on:** identical data, shared timestamps, shared participants, shared artifacts, repeated patterns of action (purely factual).

### Answers
> **"WHAT connects these two nodes?"**

### NEVER ⚡
| Forbidden |
|-----------|
| why it happened |
| what should happen |
| inferred motivations |

### Factual Thread JSON ⚡
```json
{
  "thread_factual": {
    "nodes": ["id_A", "id_B"],
    "reason": "shared_artifact|same_timestamp|repeated_pattern",
    "hash": "sha256"
  }
}
```

### 2) CONTEXTUAL THREADS (SITUATIONAL LINKS) ⚡

### Description
> **Links items by environment or scenario, not content.**

### Examples ⚡
| Example |
|---------|
| Same sphere (Business/Scholar/etc.) |
| Same meeting type (decision/creative/review) |
| **Same XR room preset** |
| **Same topic category** |

### Answers
> **"WHERE and WHEN do these connections occur?"**

### NEVER ⚡
| Forbidden |
|-----------|
| priority |
| recommendations |

### Contextual Thread JSON ⚡
```json
{
  "thread_contextual": {
    "context": "sphere|mode|topic",
    "nodes": ["id_A", "id_B", "id_C"],
    "visibility": "user|team|global"
  }
}
```

---

### 3) HISTORICAL THREADS (TIME-STRUCTURED LINKS) ⚡

### Description
> **Represents evolution through time:** changes in decisions, expansions of a project, sequence of meetings, iterative versions of documents, avatar or room evolution snapshots.

### Answers
> **"How did this evolve?"**

### Rules ⚡
| Rule | Status |

    ],
    "integrity": "verified"
  }
}
```

| **user chooses visibility level** | ✅ ⚡ |

### Cross-Sphere Thread JSON ⚡
