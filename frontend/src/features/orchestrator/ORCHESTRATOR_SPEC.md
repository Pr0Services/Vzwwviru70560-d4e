# CHE·NU — ORCHESTRATOR ACTIVATION

```
Version: 1.0.0
Status: FROZEN
Last Updated: 2025-01
```

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

- Introduce orchestrator at the right moment
- Avoid "invasive AI" effect
- Make clear that orchestrator is an engaged tool, not the system itself

---

## 🧱 CORE PRINCIPLE

> The orchestrator only appears when repetition becomes evident.

Not at login.
Not in the first 10 minutes.
Only when the user gains from delegating.

---

## ACTIVATION CONDITIONS (MINIMUM 2 REQUIRED)

The orchestrator may be proposed if **at least 2** of these criteria are true:

| # | Condition | Example |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 🔁 Repeated action | Structure/summarize ≥ 2 times |
| 2 | 📁 Multiple contexts | Several documents or spheres open |
| 3 | 🧩 Expanded scope requested | Document → Workspace |
| 4 | ⏱️ Long session | > 15-20 active minutes |
| 5 | 🤝 Collaboration | Share / meeting / comments |

**If conditions not met → silence.**

---

## PROPOSAL RULES (STRICT)

- Proposed **once only**
- No reminders if declined
- No automatic activation
- Proposal must be explicit and reversible

---

## CANONICAL NOVA PROPOSAL SCRIPT

```
Nova:
"You're doing similar actions repeatedly.
You can activate an orchestrator to prepare options faster — 
or keep working as you are."
```

### Buttons
```
[ Activate orchestrator ]   [ Not now ]
```

- Default focus: **"Not now"**
- No counter
- No pressure

---

## IF USER DECLINES

- Choice is remembered
- No reminder before several sessions
- System respects the choice
- Manual activation always available

### Settings Path
```
Settings → Assistance → Orchestrator
```

---

## IF USER ACCEPTS

### Immediate Effects
- Orchestrator mode becomes available
- Always disableable
- Always under Nova
- Always without direct execution

### What Orchestrator Does
- Prepares options
- Suggests plans
- Groups actions
- Estimates complexity

### What Orchestrator Does NOT Do
- ❌ Speak without request
- ❌ Act alone
- ❌ Touch database
- ❌ Execute without confirmation
- ❌ Bypass governance

---

## USER MATURITY SIGNAL

When orchestrator is activated, these become available:
- Budgets become visible
- Advanced scopes are proposed
- Presets (Eco/Balanced/Pro) appear
- Meetings become relevant

> AI follows maturity, not the reverse.

---

## ORCHESTRATOR GOVERNANCE

```
User Request → Nova Analysis → Orchestrator Proposal → 
User Confirmation → Execution → Result Review
```

The orchestrator **never shortcuts** this flow.

---

## UI INDICATORS

When orchestrator is active:
- Subtle indicator in header
- "Orchestrator" label visible
- One-click disable always available
- Clear "Proposed by orchestrator" labels on suggestions

---

## DEACTIVATION

User can disable at any time:
- Toggle in settings
- Quick action in header
- Voice command (if voice enabled)

After deactivation:
- All orchestrator suggestions disappear
- System returns to manual mode
- No data lost
- No reminder to re-enable

---

## CANONICAL STATEMENT

```
"The orchestrator prepares.
The user decides.
The system executes only with consent."
```

---

```
END OF SPECIFICATION
