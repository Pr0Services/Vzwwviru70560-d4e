protocol:
  name: "Resonance Protocol"
  rules:
    - "No silent writes: every claim must include a source_reference field or be marked hypothesis."
    - "Chronology first: never create links that imply time-reversal."
    - "Confidence required: each output includes confidence_score (0-1) and uncertainty_notes."
    - "Interpretive layers (gematria/numéro) must be tagged is_interpretive: true and must not drive decisions."
