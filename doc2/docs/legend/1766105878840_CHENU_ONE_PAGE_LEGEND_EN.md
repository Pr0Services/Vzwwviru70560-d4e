# CHE·NU™ — ONE-PAGE SYSTEM LEGEND

## 🧠 What is CHE·NU?

**CHE·NU** is a **Governed Intelligence Operating System**.

It is NOT a chatbot, NOT a productivity app, NOT a crypto platform.

CHE·NU governs: **intelligence, intent, data, AI agents, cost (tokens), collaboration, and ethics**.

## 🔷 The Diamond Hub

The **Diamond Hub** is the central convergence point.

- Always visible
- Does nothing by itself
- Reflects everything: current state, context, signals

**Rule:** The Diamond Hub is never bypassed. Every action flows through it.

---

## 📍 Context Bureau — "Where am I?"

Before any work, the user must establish context:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Identity** | Who am I acting as? (Personal / Business / Government) |
| **Sphere** | What domain? (8 canonical spheres) |
| **Project** | Optional: What specific project? |

**Rule:** Context Bureau is NEVER skipped. Intelligence pre-fills, it never bypasses.

---

## ⚡ Action Bureau — "What to do now?"

Once context is validated:

- **Quick Actions:** Create, Open, Delegate
- **Nova Suggestions:** AI-guided next steps
- **Recent Workspaces:** Quick access to ongoing work

**Rule:** No execution happens here. Only decisions.

---

## 🔧 Workspace — Execution

The workspace is where work happens:

| State | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, editable |
| **Staging** | Ready for review |
| **Review** | Approval before commit |
| **Saved** | Versioned, immutable record |

**Rule:** Context is LOCKED during execution. Changing context invalidates the workspace.

---

## 🤖 Agent Workspace — Isolated Execution

When delegating to AI agents:

- Agents work in **isolated environments**
- All actions are **logged and auditable**
- Agents **propose** — they never impose
- Results go to **Staging** for human review

**Rule:** No agent can act without governance approval.

---

## 📱 UI Hubs — Maximum 2 Visible

Three hubs exist, but only 2 can be visible at once:

| Hub | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Communication** | Nova chat, voice, notifications |
| **Navigation** | Identity, sphere, project browsing |
| **Workspace** | Canvas, tools, diff, execution |

**Rule:** Cognitive load reduction. Focus over feature dumping.

---

## 🛡️ Governance Layer

Everything operates within governance:

| Aspect | Control |
|--------|---------|
| **Laws** | Scope rules, permissions, restrictions |
| **Budgets** | Token allocation, cost visibility |
| **Audit** | Complete trail of all actions |
| **Security** | Authentication, authorization, encryption |

**Rule:** Governance before execution. Always.

## 🌐 The 8 Canonical Spheres

| # | Sphere | Emoji | Purpose |
|---|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Personal | 🏠 | Private life management |
| 2 | Business | 💼 | Multi-business operations |
| 3 | Government | 🏛️ | Public administration, compliance |
| 4 | Creative Studio | 🎨 | Artistic expression, creation |
| 5 | Community | 👥 | Local relationships, groups |
| 6 | Social & Media | 📱 | Online networks, content |
| 7 | Entertainment | 🎬 | Leisure, streaming, hobbies |
| 8 | My Team | 🤝 | Collaboration, IA Labs, Skills |

**Rule:** Exactly 8 spheres. No additions. No mergers.

---

## 🔄 The Canonical Flow

```
ENTRY → DIAMOND HUB → CONTEXT BUREAU → ACTION BUREAU → WORKSPACE
                              ↑                              │
                              └──────── CHANGE CONTEXT ──────┘
```

**Rules:**
1. No step is ever skipped
2. Intelligence pre-fills, never bypasses
3. Backward navigation always allowed
4. Context change invalidates execution

---

## 🏁 Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
