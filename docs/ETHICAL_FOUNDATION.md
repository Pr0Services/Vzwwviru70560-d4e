CHE·NU is a sovereign multi-agent operating space.

No agent makes decisions on behalf of users.
No moral judgment or scoring is performed.
No behavioral nudging or silent optimization occurs.

Responsibility always remains human.
The system is co-responsible for clarity, never for choice.

All assistance is explicit, voluntary, and reversible.
Silence mode disables all analysis and observation.

Observable consequences may be shown, never evaluated.

Ethics Checkpoints are non-intrusive, optional, and ignorable.
They never block, judge, or persist state.
They appear only when responsibility changes scale.

This foundation applies to the core system, all agents, all spheres, XR extensions, and all future development.

Any evolution must remain compatible with this foundation.
