## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE

This is the **BIOS** of CHE·NU™.

- No other document may contradict this one.
- Any conflict → this document wins.
- Any doubt → return to this document.

---

## 1. WHAT IS CHE·NU™

CHE·NU™ (Chez Nous — "At Home") is a **Governed Intelligence Operating System**.

### It IS:
- A context-based operating system for AI-human collaboration
- A governance layer for intelligence, intent, and data
- A unified workspace organizing all life domains
- A cost-controlled, auditable AI execution environment

### It is NOT:
- ❌ A chatbot
- ❌ A productivity app
- ❌ A cryptocurrency platform
- ❌ A social network
- ❌ An autonomous AI system

---

## 2. NON-NEGOTIABLE LAWS

### Law 1: Context Over Features
CHE·NU operates by **CONTEXT** (Spheres), not by feature menus.

### Law 2: 8 Spheres — FROZEN
Exactly 8 spheres. No more. No less. No merging. No splitting.

### Law 3: 10 Bureau Sections — FIXED
Every sphere opens a Bureau with exactly 10 sections. Always the same structure.

### Law 4: Threads Are First-Class
Threads (.chenu) are persistent, owned, budgeted, auditable conversation objects.

### Law 5: Tokens ≠ Crypto
Tokens are internal utility credits representing "intelligence energy." NOT cryptocurrency.

### Law 6: Governance Before Execution
Every AI action passes through governance validation before execution.

### Law 7: Nova Is System
Nova is the system intelligence. Always present. Never hired. Cannot be replaced.

### Law 8: Human Authority
Humans always have final control. AI suggests, humans decide.

## 3. THE 8 SPHERES (FROZEN)

| # | ID | Name | Icon | Description |
|---|-----|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `personal` | Personal | 🏠 | Private life management |
| 2 | `business` | Business | 💼 | Professional & enterprise work |
| 3 | `government` | Government & Institutions | 🏛️ | Civic engagement, administration |
| 4 | `studio` | Studio de création | 🎨 | Creative projects & production |
| 5 | `community` | Community | 👥 | Groups, associations, causes |
| 6 | `social` | Social & Media | 📱 | Social presence & media |
| 7 | `entertainment` | Entertainment | 🎬 | Leisure, culture, hobbies |
| 8 | `team` | My Team | 🤝 | Internal team (includes IA Labs & Skills) |

### Sphere Rules:
- No 9th sphere allowed
- No sphere can be deleted
- No sphere can be renamed
- No sphere can be merged
- IA Labs and Skills & Tools are **INSIDE** My Team, not separate spheres

---

## 4. THE 10 BUREAU SECTIONS (FIXED)

Every sphere opens a **Bureau** containing exactly these sections:

| # | ID | Name | Purpose |
|---|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | `dashboard` | Dashboard | Overview & quick actions |
| 2 | `notes` | Notes | Persistent documentation |
| 3 | `tasks` | Tasks | Action items & todos |
| 4 | `projects` | Projects | Multi-task initiatives |
| 5 | `threads` | Threads (.chenu) | Persistent AI conversations |
| 6 | `meetings` | Meetings | Scheduled interactions |
| 7 | `data` | Data / Database | Structured information |
| 8 | `agents` | Agents | AI assistants for this sphere |
| 9 | `reports` | Reports / History | Activity logs & analytics |
| 10 | `budget` | Budget & Governance | Token management & rules |

### Bureau Rules:
- This structure NEVER changes
- Only content, permissions, and agents vary per sphere
- No sections can be added
- No sections can be removed

---

## 5. THE 3 HUBS

CHE·NU UI is organized around 3 hubs:

### Hub 1: CENTER (Main Workspace)
- Active sphere's Bureau
- Current context
- Primary work area

### Hub 2: LEFT (Navigation)
- Sphere selector
- Quick access
- Global search

### Hub 3: BOTTOM/RIGHT (Intelligence)
- Nova presence
- Active agents
- Token status
- Notifications

---

## 6. THREAD SYSTEM (.chenu)

Threads are **first-class objects**:

```
Thread Properties:
├── id: unique identifier
├── title: human-readable name
├── sphere_id: context boundary
├── owner_id: human owner
├── status: active | paused | completed | archived
├── token_budget: allocated intelligence credits
├── tokens_used: consumed credits
├── encoding_mode: compression strategy
├── messages[]: conversation history
├── decisions[]: recorded decisions
└── audit_log[]: full traceability
```

### Thread Rules:
- Every thread belongs to exactly one sphere
- Every thread has a token budget
- Every thread is auditable
- Threads persist across sessions

---

## 7. TOKEN SYSTEM

### Definition
Tokens are **INTERNAL UTILITY CREDITS** representing "intelligence energy."

### Tokens ARE:
- ✅ Budgeted per sphere/project/meeting
- ✅ Traceable (every consumption logged)
- ✅ Governed (rules can limit usage)
- ✅ Transferable (with rules)
- ✅ Visible (users see their costs)

### Tokens are NOT:
- ❌ Cryptocurrency
- ❌ Speculative assets
- ❌ Market-traded
- ❌ External currency

---

## 8. AGENT GOVERNANCE

### Nova (System Intelligence)
- **Type:** System agent
- **Presence:** Always active
- **Role:** Guidance, memory, governance, supervision
- **Hiring:** Cannot be hired (system-level)
- **Scope:** All spheres

### User Orchestrator
- **Type:** User-hired agent
- **Role:** Task execution, agent management
- **Hiring:** Hired by user
- **Scope:** Assigned spheres
- **Replaceability:** Can be customized/replaced

### Specialist Agents
- **Type:** Domain specialists
- **Role:** Specific capabilities
- **Hiring:** Hired from marketplace
- **Scope:** Limited to authorized spheres
- **Cost:** Per-token billing

### Agent Rules:
1. All agents respect scope boundaries
2. All agents respect token budgets
3. All actions require governance validation
4. All actions are logged and auditable
5. Nova supervises all agent activity

---

## 9. GOVERNANCE PIPELINE

Every AI execution follows this 10-step pipeline:

```
1. Intent Classification    → What is the user trying to do?
2. Scope Validation        → Is this allowed in this sphere?
3. Agent Selection         → Which agent(s) should handle this?
4. Budget Verification     → Are there enough tokens?
5. Encoding Application    → Compress for efficiency
6. Execution Authorization → Final governance check
7. Task Execution          → Agent performs work
8. Result Assembly         → Compile outputs
9. Token Accounting        → Record consumption
10. User Presentation      → Display results
```

---

## 10. ENCODING SYSTEM (CORE IP)

### Purpose
Reduce token usage while preserving semantic meaning.

### Process
```
Input → Encode → AI Processing → Decode → Output
```

### Properties
- Reversible for humans
- Compatible with agents
- Measurable quality score
- Key competitive advantage

### Rule
Encoding ALWAYS happens BEFORE execution.

---

## 11. ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Add new spheres beyond 8
- ❌ Rename existing spheres
- ❌ Merge bureau sections
- ❌ Bypass governance pipeline
- ❌ Treat CHE·NU as a generic AI app
- ❌ Convert tokens into speculative crypto
- ❌ Make Nova a hired agent
- ❌ Allow autonomous AI execution
- ❌ Sell user attention
- ❌ Sell user data

### ALWAYS:
- ✅ Favor clarity over features
- ✅ Favor separation over fusion
- ✅ Favor governance over automation
- ✅ Maintain human authority
- ✅ Log all AI actions
- ✅ Respect token budgets
- ✅ Enforce scope boundaries
