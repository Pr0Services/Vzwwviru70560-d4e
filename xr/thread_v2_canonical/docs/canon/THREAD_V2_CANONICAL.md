# CHE-NU — Official Thread Definition (v2)
**Status:** Foundation · Non-negotiable

## 1) Official definition
A **CHE-NU Thread** is the sovereign unit of **meaning, memory, and continuity** in the system.

A thread:
- exists independently of interfaces
- persists across time
- connects **intention → action → decision → consequence → learning**
- is the **single source of truth**

A thread is **not**:
- a chat
- a project
- a meeting
- a folder
- an XR room

All of those are **projections** of the thread.

## 2) Minimum contents (canonical)
Every thread contains, at minimum:

### Identity
- `thread_id`
- `type`: `personal | collective | inter_sphere`
- `founding_intent`
- `created_at`
- `status`: `active | dormant | archived` (never “deleted”)

### Context
- problem/cause description
- spheres involved
- known constraints
- initial hypotheses

### Structured memory
- decisions (what, why, who)
- actions (what, when, result)
- events (lives, milestones)
- errors (non-judgmental)
- explicit learnings

### Participants
- humans (roles + rights)
- **exactly one thread memory agent** (mandatory)
- optional helpers (coordination, research, etc.)

### Links
- links to other threads
- dependencies
- lineage (a thread may spawn other threads)

## 3) Mandatory role: Thread Memory Agent
Each thread has **exactly one** dedicated **Memory Agent**.
Its responsibilities:
- preserve thread coherence and founding intent
- link decisions → consequences
- produce reliable summaries
- enable instant onboarding
- prevent semantic drift

It must **not**:
- replace human sovereignty
- run continuously
- execute heavy operational actions

**Memory lives in the thread.** The agent is the guardian.

## 4) Interaction modes (projections)
A thread can be experienced in multiple ways:
- **Chat** = conversational view
- **Live** = time-bounded high-intensity segment
- **XR Environment** = spatial projection

None of these has its own memory.
They read/write the **same thread**.

## 5) Canonical schema (simple)
```
THREAD (single source of truth)
  ├─ Chat UI   (view)
  ├─ Live UI   (state/segment)
  └─ XR Room   (projection)
        |
   Memory Agent (guardian, on-demand)
```

## 6) Strictly forbidden
1. Duplicated memory (chat/live/xr)
2. Always-on agents (persistent runtime “watchers”)
3. Autonomous environments (XR rooms without threads)
4. Mutating history (no silent rewrites; append-only)
5. Opaque automation (agent taking sovereignty)

## 7) Closing line (canonical)
> In CHE-NU, everything starts with a thread, everything is written to it, and nothing exists outside it.
