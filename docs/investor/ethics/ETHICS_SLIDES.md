# CHE·NU — Investor Ethics Presentation

---

## SLIDE 1 — Title

# CHE·NU

**Ethics by Architecture, not Policy**

---

## SLIDE 2 — Problem

Most AI systems today:

- make implicit decisions
- shape behavior without consent
- centralize authority
- blur responsibility

This creates trust, regulatory,
and adoption risks.

---

## SLIDE 3 — Our Approach

CHE·NU takes a different path:

- Human sovereignty by design
- No algorithmic moral authority
- Co-responsibility = shared clarity
- Explicit intent, explicit limits

---

## SLIDE 4 — Frozen Ethical Core

- Agents never decide
- No moral scoring
- No hidden nudging
- No silent optimization

This foundation is:

- versioned
- hashed
- auditable

---

## SLIDE 5 — Co-Responsibility Model

**User:**
- defines intent
- sets boundaries
- decides actions

**System:**
- increases clarity
- shows consequences
- signals misalignment (non-judgmental)

---

## SLIDE 6 — Ethics Checkpoints

🧭 **Structural moments of clarity**

Not rules. Not approvals. Not controls.

An Ethics Checkpoint is a non-intrusive moment where:
- the active context is made explicit
- responsibility remains human
- reflection is optional

**No blocking. No scoring. No judgment.**

Appears only at:
- task creation
- context change
- XR activation
- export/publication

---

## SLIDE 7 — Why This Matters

- safer long-term scaling
- regulatory resilience
- institutional trust
- ethical differentiation

---

## SLIDE 8 — Summary

✅ Ethics frozen at the core

✅ Responsibility stays human

✅ Transparency without coercion

✅ Built to scale safely
