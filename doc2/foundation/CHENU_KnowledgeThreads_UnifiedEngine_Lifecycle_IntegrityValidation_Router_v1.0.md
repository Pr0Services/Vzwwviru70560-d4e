# CHE·NU — KNOWLEDGE THREAD ENGINE
**VERSION:** KT.v1.0  
**MODE:** FOUNDATION / CROSS-SPHERE / READ-ONLY MEMORY

---

## CORE PURPOSE

> Unify all Knowledge Threads (Personal, Collective, Inter-Sphere) into a single universal engine that:
> - **CONNECTS** information without interpreting it
> - **LINKS** memories without rewriting them
> - **SHOWS** patterns without suggesting conclusions

### RULE
> **Threads = STRUCTURAL RELATIONS. NOT emotional, NOT persuasive, NOT inferential.**

---

## THREAD TYPES (3 PILLARS) ⚡

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `THREAD_PERSONAL` | user's private notes, decisions, replays; **never visible to others unless explicitly shared**; stored as **encrypted micro-nodes** ⚡ |
| `THREAD_COLLECTIVE` | validated meeting events, decisions, artifacts; **immutable, global index**; sphere-organized clusters ⚡ |
| `THREAD_INTERSPHERE` | neutral bridges between spheres; **NO causal or evaluative language**; **ONLY structural relationships (A references B)** ⚡ |

---

## THREAD OBJECT MODEL ⚡

```json
{
  "THREAD": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "personal|collective|intersphere",
    "origin": "meeting|note|artifact|agent",
    "timestamp": 1712345678,
    "sphere": "business|scholar|creative|institution|...",
    "links": ["thread_id_1", "thread_id_2"],
    "payload_ref": "artifact_id|replay_frame_id",
    "hash": "sha256",
    "visibility": "private|shared|global",
    "status": "active|merged|archived"
  }
}
```

### Thread Fields ⚡
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `origin` | **meeting/note/artifact/agent** ⚡ |
| `visibility` | **private/shared/global** ⚡ |
| `status` | **active/merged/archived** ⚡ |

## THREAD CREATION RULES ⚡

### AUTO-GENERATED ⚡
| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| meeting decisions | ✅ |
| cross-sphere reference usage | ✅ |
| XR replay artifacts | ✅ |
| pinned notes | ✅ |

### MANUAL ⚡
| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| user annotation | ✅ |
| agent commentary (explanation only) | ✅ |
| explicit "link A to B" request | ✅ |

### NEVER GENERATED BY ⚡
| Forbidden | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **inferred intent** | ❌ ⚡ |
| **predicted emotion** | ❌ ⚡ |
| **sentiment models** | ❌ ⚡ |

---

## THREAD LIFECYCLE ⚡ (NOUVEAU!)

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ACTIVE** | visible in Universe View, **can grow with new links** ⚡ |
| **MERGED** | absorbed into a larger thread cluster, **maintains reference history** ⚡ |
| **ARCHIVED** | preserved in Collective Memory, **removed from active navigation** ⚡ |
| **FROZEN** | **cryptographically sealed**, used for audits or reference, **cannot mutate** ⚡ |

---

## CROSS-SPHERE KNOWLEDGE ROUTING ⚡

### Routing Logic ⚡
```
if Thread A references Thread B
AND spheres differ:
  → create INTERSPHERE LINK
  BUT:
    - no implication of causality
    - no ranking or direction
    - neutral representation only
```

### Examples ⚡
| From | To | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Scholar | → Business | research to application ⚡ |
| Creative | → Social | media to outreach ⚡ |
| XR | → Methodology | behavioral clarifications ⚡ |

---

## UNIVERSE VIEW — THREAD RENDERING ⚡

### Rendering Rules ⚡
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **thread = semi-transparent line** | ⚡ |
| **color = sphere or type** | ⚡ |
| **thickness = number of connections** | ⚡ |
| **no pulsation or emotional cues** | ⚡ |

### Modes ⚡
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `MODE_MINIMAL` | only major clusters ⚡ |
| `MODE_STRUCTURAL` | all thread patterns ⚡ |
| `MODE_TEMPORAL` | **timeline-first layout** ⚡ |
| `MODE_SPATIAL` | **sphere-first orbit layout** ⚡ |

---

## THREAD INTEGRITY ENGINE ⚡ (NOUVEAU!)

### Every Thread Is ⚡
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **hashed on creation** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **cross-hashed in clusters** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **validated on replay import** | ✅ ⚡ |
| **verified before merging** | ✅ ⚡ |

### Thread Integrity JSON ⚡

```json
{
  "THREAD_INTEGRITY": {
    "thread_id": "...",
    "current_hash": "...",
    "validation_state": "clean|conflict|corrupted",
    "source_proof": "replay_hash|artifact_hash"
  }
}
```

### Validation States ⚡
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `clean` | ✅ verified ⚡ |
| `conflict` | ⚠️ needs resolution ⚡ |
| `corrupted` | ❌ integrity failure ⚡ |
